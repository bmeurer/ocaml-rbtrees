Synopsis:    An implementation of Red-Black Trees for OCaml
Description:
  This is my implementation of Red-Black Trees for OCaml. It is based upon
  the implementation described in the paper "Red-Black Trees in a Functional
  Setting" by Chris Okasaki published in "Journal of Functional Programming",
  9(4):471-477, July 1999.
  .
  The Red-Black Trees are exposed via a map and a set API, which is designed
  to be compatible with the Map and Set modules in the OCaml standard library
  (which are implemented using AVL trees). You can use the Rbmap and Rbset 
  modules as drop-in replacement for the Map and Set modules.
