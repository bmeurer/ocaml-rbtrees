An implementation of Red-Black Trees for OCaml

This is my implementation of Red-Black Trees for OCaml. It is based upon the
implementation described in the paper "Red-Black Trees in a Functional
Setting" by Chris Okasaki published in "Journal of Functional Programming",
9(4):471-477, July 1999.

The Red-Black Trees are exposed via a map and a set API, which is designed to
be compatible with the Map and Set modules in the OCaml standard library
(which are implemented using AVL trees). You can use the Rbmap and Rbset
modules as drop-in replacement for the Map and Set modules.

See the files INSTALL.txt for building and installation instructions. See the
file LICENSE for copying conditions.
